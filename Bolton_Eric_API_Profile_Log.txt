[01/30/18 01:38:46 PM] Set up environment with the files twitch_api.py and 
twitch_credentials.py
[01/30/18 01:40:51 PM] Began reading 
https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication#registration
[01/30/18 01:42:49 PM] Set up application "Eric Bolton's Twitch Search" at 
https://dev.twitch.tv/dashboard/apps/create
[01/30/18 01:52:17 PM] Switching to new API, the Twitch only seems to provide 
data for personal use cases
[01/30/18 02:18:10 PM] Have chosen the opencorporates API.
[01/30/18 02:36:53 PM] Usage without API keys is restricted to usage limits, so 
I'm creating an account at https://opencorporates.com/api_accounts/new
[01/30/18 02:38:33 PM] Signing up with a 'Public Benefit' account
[01/30/18 02:41:33 PM] Setting up account under organization 'Columbia 
University' and url 'https://www.columbia.edu'
[01/30/18 03:12:51 PM] API key info will be provided within the next 48 hours, 
so I won't be able to use it.
[01/30/18 04:07:39 PM] The opencorporates API lets you perform GET requests. I 
read up on how to do these at 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-post-requests-using-python/
[01/30/18 04:42:33 PM] Performed sample API request for 'Bunge Ltd.' in browser 
to acquaint myself with format of data: 
https://api.opencorporates.com/companies/bm/20791. *I found the company ID and 
country code for ‘Bunge Ltd.’ by searching for it on the regular opencorporates 
search at: https://opencorporates.com/
[01/30/18 04:44:28 PM] Performed sample API search with 'country_code' set to 
'bm' *According to the opencorporates API Reference 
(https://api.opencorporates.com/documentation/API-Reference) country code is 
simply the two-letter ISO code for that country (‘bm’ for Bermuda).
[01/30/18 05:10:40 PM] Attempted to perform API search with 
'incorporation_date' but failed because it requires an API token. *According to 
the ‘Date filter’ entry in the opencorporates API Reference, date ranges can be 
specified using the format ‘YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD’. Omitting either start or 
end date (i.e. ‘:YYYY-MM-DD’ or ‘YYYY-MM-DD:’ corresponds to any date before 
the specified end date, or after the specified start date.
[01/30/18 05:54:24 PM] Attempted to perform API search for Bunge Ltd.'s network 
with Performed sample API search for Bunge Ltd.'s statements with 
https://api.opencorporates.com/v0.4/companies/bm/20791/network. Request 
returned no network elements
[01/30/18 06:15:59 PM] Attempted to perform searches for many large companies' 
networks. Did not find any for which opencorporates maintained data.
[01/30/18 06:29:13 PM] Performed sample API search for Bunge Ltd.'s statements 
with https://api.opencorporates.com/v0.4/companies/bm/20791/statements
[01/30/18 07:01:15 PM] Performed sample API search for CEOs in Bermuda, 
returned nothing: 
https://api.opencorporates.com/v0.4/officers/search?jurisdiction_code=bm&positio
n=ceo
[01/30/18 07:14:06 PM] Performed sample API search for officers named 'Michael 
Bloomberg' in New York state with 
https://api.opencorporates.com/v0.4/officers/search?jurisdiction_code=us_ny&q=bl
oomberg *US states are defined as separate jurisdictions, in which case the ISO 
3166-2 code is used.
[02/05/18 10:51:58 PM] Created Jupyter notebook to contain revised API Profile.
[02/05/18 11:25:18 PM] Obtained API Token for opencorporates (unavailable last 
time). I received an e-mail approving my request roughly 24 hours after 
submitting it. I found the Token by signing into opencorporates, then going to 
‘https://opencorporates.com/users/account'
[02/05/18 11:32:53 PM] Added clarification to [01/30/18 04:42:33 PM] and 
[01/30/18 04:42:33 PM] log entries.
[02/05/18 11:43:16 PM] Added clarification to [01/30/18 05:10:40 PM]  log entry.
[02/06/18 12:04:09 AM] Finished formatting Profile into markdown.
[02/06/18 12:06:15 AM] Learned how to print JSON keys at: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15789059/python-json-only-get-keys-in-first-
level
[02/06/18 12:27:39 AM] Defined function “printkeys” that makes JSON object 
format much more readable. Choosing to only print keys of first entries in 
lists, since different entries can have different properties, leading to 
different JSON objects.
[02/06/18 01:51:42 PM] Found list of ISO country codes at 
‘http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm'
[02/06/18 01:53:50 PM] Parsed JSON results for Query 1 again to see which 
fields were typically left empty.
[02/06/18 02:28:23 PM] Repeated above exercise for Queries 2 and 3.
